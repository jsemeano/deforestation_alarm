## This repository contains the jupyter notebooks used in the exploration of Geodata datasets (namely AWS's https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs).

## The functions performed are:
- accessing cloud optimized geotiffs from AWS
- chipping the images mantaining the information about the location of each chip
- saving the selected chips to a Google Cloud Platform bucket
- saving images as .tif files to be tagged with azavea's GroundWork software
